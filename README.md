What is it? 
Brobot is a confiurable script that polls targeted web pages for key messages, or the absence thereof (i.e. "Out of Stock"), 
and sends a text notification to the user to complete the purchase when the item in question comes back in to stock. 

Why did I create it? 
BroBot was written during the supply chain outages of COVID19. I was no longer going to a commercial gym, and I was looking 
for certain gym equipment to purchase, but many things were out of stock, and would go out of stock almost immediately.
